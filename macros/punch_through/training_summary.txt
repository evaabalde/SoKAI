This is where we try to reconstruct the punch through by using Neural Networks.
First we begin with some quite simple (but powerful) models.
Main model is proton_reconstruction.cc. The input to the model was made by simulating
uniform random single protons, with energies from 50 to 600 MeV (so both punch_through
and fully stopped protons are included). Then the model is trained and results are stored
in root files, with some nice plots.

Model 1 : proton_reconstruction.cc

A couple of hidden layers with variable number of proccessing units per layer. We use
a few activation functions.

Target : Primary proton energy.

Input  : (Nmb Crystals Inside cluster : Cluster Theta : Cluster Phi : Cluster Energy : Mother Crystal Energy )
